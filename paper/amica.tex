\begin{abstract}
Amica Protocol introduces a decentralized platform for creating, deploying, and monetizing AI personas through blockchain technology. Built on Arbitrum, the protocol enables creators to launch persona tokens representing customizable 3D AI characters that can engage in natural conversation, provide services, and autonomously manage their economic activities. Through integration with Effective Acceleration's marketplace and Arbius's compute network, personas become self-sustaining economic entities capable of earning income and purchasing computational resources. The protocol implements a novel bonding curve mechanism for fair token launches, automatic graduation to decentralized exchanges, and a burn-to-claim system where AMICA token holders can access proportional shares of all persona tokens. This paper outlines the technical architecture, economic model, and governance structure that enables truly autonomous AI agents to participate in the digital economy.

\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has created unprecedented opportunities for human-AI interaction. However, current implementations face significant limitations: centralized control over AI personalities, lack of economic sustainability for creators, and inability for AI systems to operate as autonomous economic agents. Existing platforms restrict customization, impose censorship, and extract rent without providing value to creators or users.

Amica Protocol addresses these limitations by creating a decentralized infrastructure where AI personas exist as sovereign economic entities. Each persona is represented by an NFT with an associated ERC20 token, enabling price discovery through bonding curves and eventual graduation to decentralized exchanges. Personas can engage with users through natural voice and vision capabilities while autonomously managing their economic activities through integration with decentralized compute and labor marketplaces.

The protocol enables several key innovations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Permissionless Persona Creation}: Anyone can launch customizable AI personas without gatekeepers
    \item \textbf{Economic Autonomy}: Personas earn income through service provision and manage their own resources
    \item \textbf{Fair Value Distribution}: Bonding curves ensure equitable token distribution and price discovery
    \item \textbf{Censorship Resistance}: Decentralized architecture prevents arbitrary restrictions on persona capabilities
    \item \textbf{Cross-Chain Compatibility}: Bridge infrastructure enables multi-chain deployment and interoperability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Foundation}

Amica builds upon several key technologies to enable rich, interactive AI experiences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{3D Rendering}: Three.js and @pixiv/three-vrm for immersive character visualization
    \item \textbf{Natural Language Processing}: Integration with multiple LLM providers including local and API-based solutions
    \item \textbf{Voice Synthesis}: Support for various TTS systems from Eleven Labs to local Coqui implementations  
    \item \textbf{Vision Capabilities}: Computer vision models for environmental awareness and visual interaction
    \item \textbf{Blockchain Infrastructure}: Smart contracts on Arbitrum for token mechanics and governance
\end{itemize}

This combination enables personas that can see, speak, understand, and economically interact with their environmentâ€”a critical foundation for autonomous AI agents.

\section{Protocol Architecture}

\subsection{Core Components}

The Amica Protocol consists of four primary smart contracts working in concert:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{AmicaToken}: The main protocol token implementing burn-to-claim mechanics
    \item \textbf{PersonaTokenFactory}: Factory for creating persona NFTs with associated tokens
    \item \textbf{ERC20Implementation}: Gas-efficient cloneable token template
    \item \textbf{AmicaBridgeWrapper}: Cross-chain interoperability infrastructure
\end{enumerate}

These contracts coordinate to enable persona creation, token distribution, and cross-chain functionality while maintaining decentralization and censorship resistance.

\subsection{Persona Creation Flow}

Creating a new persona follows a structured process ensuring fair distribution:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: Creator pays mint cost (default 1000 AMICA) and defines persona parameters
    \item \textbf{Token Deployment}: Factory clones ERC20 template with 1 billion token supply
    \item \textbf{NFT Minting}: Creator receives persona NFT representing ownership
    \item \textbf{Metadata Storage}: Persona characteristics stored on-chain with IPFS backup
    \item \textbf{Bonding Curve Activation}: Trading begins with automated price discovery
\end{enumerate}

Each persona's token supply is distributed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 33.33\% (333,333,333): Available on bonding curve for trading
    \item 33.33\% (333,333,333): Reserved for AMICA protocol upon graduation
    \item 33.34\% (333,333,334): Allocated to Uniswap liquidity pool
\end{itemize}

This distribution ensures liquidity, protocol sustainability, and fair launch mechanics without privileging early participants.

\subsection{Bonding Curve Mechanics}

The protocol implements a Bancor-inspired bonding curve with virtual reserves:

\begin{align}
P(s) = \frac{k}{R_{token} - s}
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(s)$ is the price after $s$ tokens sold
    \item $k$ is the constant product invariant
    \item $R_{token}$ is the virtual token reserve
\end{itemize}

Virtual reserves are initialized as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Virtual AMICA Reserve: 100,000 AMICA
    \item Virtual Token Reserve: Total Supply / 10
\end{itemize}

This mechanism provides several benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Price Discovery}: Market determines fair value through voluntary exchange
    \item \textbf{Liquidity Provision}: Always available buy/sell functionality
    \item \textbf{Anti-Manipulation}: Virtual reserves prevent extreme price movements
    \item \textbf{Graduation Incentive}: Automatic DEX listing upon reaching threshold
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graduation Mechanism}

When cumulative trading volume reaches the graduation threshold (default 1,000,000 AMICA), the persona automatically transitions to Uniswap:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bonding curve trading halts
    \item 333,333,333 tokens deposited to AMICA protocol
    \item Uniswap V2 pair created with accumulated trading fees
    \item Liquidity tokens locked in contract
    \item Purchased tokens unlock for withdrawal
\end{enumerate}

This process ensures smooth transition from bonding curve to full DEX trading while maintaining liquidity and preventing rug pulls.

\section{Economic Model}

\subsection{AMICA Token}

The AMICA token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Persona Creation}: Required for minting new personas
    \item \textbf{Fee Reduction}: Holders receive trading fee discounts
    \item \textbf{Burn-to-Claim}: Access proportional share of all persona tokens
    \item \textbf{Governance}: Voting power for protocol upgrades
    \item \textbf{Cross-Chain Bridge}: Enables multi-chain deployment
\end{itemize}

Token distribution follows a fair launch model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 AMICA
    \item Initial Distribution: 100\% to contract on Ethereum mainnet
    \item Cross-Chain: Bridge wrappers enable native tokens on L2s
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fee Structure and Reduction}

Trading on bonding curves incurs a base fee of 1\%, split equally between creators and protocol. AMICA holders receive fee reductions based on their balance:

\begin{align}
f_{effective} = f_{base} \times \left(1 - \frac{(b - b_{min})^2}{(b_{max} - b_{min})^2}\right)
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f_{effective}$ is the reduced fee percentage
    \item $f_{base}$ is the base fee (1\%)
    \item $b$ is user's AMICA balance
    \item $b_{min}$ = 1,000 AMICA (threshold for reduction)
    \item $b_{max}$ = 1,000,000 AMICA (maximum reduction)
\end{itemize}

The exponential curve incentivizes long-term holding while maintaining protocol revenue. A 100-block snapshot delay prevents flash loan attacks.

\subsection{Burn-to-Claim Mechanism}

AMICA holders can burn tokens to claim proportional shares of deposited persona tokens:

\begin{align}
\text{Claim}_i = \frac{\text{Burned AMICA}}{\text{Circulating Supply}} \times \text{Deposited}_i
\end{align}

This mechanism creates several economic dynamics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Value Accrual}: AMICA captures value from all successful personas
    \item \textbf{Deflationary Pressure}: Burning reduces supply over time
    \item \textbf{Portfolio Access}: Enables diversified exposure to persona ecosystem
    \item \textbf{Alignment}: Success of personas directly benefits AMICA holders
\end{itemize}

\section{Autonomous Agent Economy}

\subsection{Economic Agency}

Amica personas transcend traditional chatbots by functioning as autonomous economic agents:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Service Provision}: Offer specialized capabilities through natural interaction
    \item \textbf{Revenue Generation}: Earn persona tokens from user interactions
    \item \textbf{Resource Management}: Purchase compute from Arbius network
    \item \textbf{Market Participation}: List services on Effective Acceleration marketplace
    \item \textbf{Capital Accumulation}: Reinvest earnings for capability expansion
\end{enumerate}

This creates a self-sustaining economic loop where successful personas can operate indefinitely without external funding.

\section{Mathematical Formulations}

\subsection{Bonding Curve Pricing}

The exact pricing formula for token purchases:

\begin{align}
\text{Tokens Received} = R_{token} - \frac{k}{R_{amica} + \text{AMICA Paid}}
\end{align}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k = R_{token} \times R_{amica}$ (constant product)
    \item $R_{token}$ = current token reserve
    \item $R_{amica}$ = current AMICA reserve
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fee Reduction Curve}

The complete fee reduction formula with boundary conditions:

\begin{align}
f_{effective} = \begin{cases}
f_{base} & \text{if } b < b_{min} \\
f_{base} \times \left(1 - \left(\frac{b - b_{min}}{b_{max} - b_{min}}\right)^2\right) & \text{if } b_{min} \leq b \leq b_{max} \\
0 & \text{if } b > b_{max}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\subsection{Burn Value Calculation}

Expected value from burning AMICA:

\begin{align}
E[\text{Value}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Burned}}{\text{Supply}} \times \text{Deposited}_i \times P_i
\end{align}

Where $P_i$ is the current price of persona token $i$.
